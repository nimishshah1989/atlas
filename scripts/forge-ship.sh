# forge-ship.sh — the institutionalised build→QA→memory→wiki→commit path.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/forge-ship.sh <chunk-id> "<one-line commit summary>"
#
# Runs, in strict order:
#   1. pytest tests/ -q                 (unit tests)
#   2. python .quality/checks.py        (71-check QA gate)
#   3. memory sync freshness check      (MEMORY status file touched < 10 min ago)
#   4. writes .forge/last-run.json      (what the pre-commit hook checks)
#   5. git commit + git push
#   6. scripts/post-chunk.sh <chunk>    (restart, smoke probe, spawn
#                                        forge-compile + auto-memory sync)
#
# If any step fails, the script exits non-zero and nothing commits. The
# pre-commit hook at ~/.forge/hooks/enforce-ship-protocol.sh refuses any
# commit without a fresh .forge/last-run.json, so this script is the only
# legal path to ship.

# deployed atlas-backend.service. Only one fork at a time may proceed through ship.
